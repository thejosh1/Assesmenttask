Did not implement the facebook functionality because the time to set up and wait for approval from facebook would have had me past the deadline. I haven't used facebook for authentication before, mostly twitter or google. would add the functionality tomorrow, but the other authentication methods work very well.

I also added the apk file to the assets folder
